Propagating updates to the ui.
    Polling
        When data in the model changes, an update is triggered. This causes the view to be traversed, looking for dirty values. 
        This only requires the controls to know which values they depend on. Potentially inefficient if there are a lot of controls.
    Pushing
        When data is changed in the model, the graph of controls depending on those changes is traversed, updating all dependent controls.
        This requires a reverse index of dependencies.
